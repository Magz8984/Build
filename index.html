         <p class="pad"><i>One Tool Many Features</i></p>
        <p>
          Building java gradle apps has never been easier. We as the build community have made it possible
          to create a tool that would revolutonalize how we , <b><i>java devs</i></b> build apps. <br>
          The major frontier  for creating this tool came from major problems i ,<span style="font-weight:bold">the author</span>
          have been facing while creating gradle directories without the help of an IDE . This would have to make me remember the project
          folder structure which at times i forgot <i>`hahaha`</i>.This resulted to me creating a tool to help me and my fellow students
          at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><b>Moringa School .</b></a>

          About

        <p>
          <b>Build</b> is a C tool originaly created by Collins Magondu Muthinja on August 29<sup>th</sup> 2018 at Moringa School.
          Here he saw the need for creating a terminal  cli that will transform how gradle apps are written ,expecially in a linux environment.That is mostly
          used by developers. <br> <br>
          The cli saw gradual increase in  use by his fellow classmates who did not make use of <i>gradle init</i> inorder to ensure
          a smaller working file structure that allowed them to focus on creating the app rather than the setup.
